#### How to add a Grant?

- Each Project has its own folder. For example, all the grants offered by IPFS are listed under [`ipfs`](./ipfs) folder.
- Each project folder will have markdown files. Add separate files for each grant. The file name for each grant should be the relevant grant name so that there is no collision in file names. You can find a template of a job post under [`template`](./template) folder.
**If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can use [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app#) and paste the Markdown here.** 
- Create a Pull Request, to add a hackathon file.

#### How To add Jobs?

- Each Project has its own folder. For example, all the jobs offered by IPFS are listed under [`ipfs`](./ipfs) folder.
- Each project folder will have markdown files. Add separate files for each position. The file name for each job post should be the position name. You can find a template of a job post under [`template`](./template) folder.
**If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can use [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app#) and paste the Markdown here.** 
- Create a Pull Request, to add a job file/folder.

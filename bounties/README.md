#### How to add a Bounties?

- Each Project has its own folder. For example, all the Bounties offered by IPFS are listed under [`ipfs`](./ipfs) folder.
- Each project folder will have markdown files. Add separate files for each Bounties. The file name for each Bounties should be the relevant Bounties name, so that there is no collosion in file names. You can find a template of a job post under [`template`](./template) folder.
**If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can use [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app#) and paste the Markdown here.** 
- Create a Pull Request, to add a hackathon file.
